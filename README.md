# Getto-Soldering-Station
I wanted to make a compact solder station from scrap so I don't have to constantly blow on the fume, so I made that during the winter of 2018

## Description

### Materials

I just got the old power supply and took out the internal components and the only thing that i kept was the fan. I also got an old charger that was laying around the home for the power. I also bought couple sheet of active carbon filter so it can filter out the zink in the zink solder.

### Build

The old charger was already been cut by my parents, so I just reorganized the wire to make a bit cleaner to use. Before I connected the charger to the fan, I connected a switch so I can turn on/off the fan a bit easier (CONVINENCE). After everything is conneceted properlly, a sheet of active carbon filter is placed infront of the fan and it is complete! 

### Further Upgrade:

I may look for a way to attach couple octopus hands and alligator clips so it can at least hold something infront of the fan.
